## üéØ Summary Key Findings:


      Strong product engagement: 22.7% view rate, but 77.3% drop after landing ‚Üí needs homepage optimization.
      
      Healthy add-to-cart rate (20.48%), but high cart (77.44%) and checkout (45.49%) abandonment ‚Üí opportunity to streamline purchase experience.
      
      AOV is solid at $81.96, but ARPU is low ($1.34) ‚Üí boost conversions to lift revenue per user.
      
      Bounce rate (32.8%) and session duration (70s) suggest room to improve site stickiness and engagement.


## ‚úÖ Funnel Analysis

Funnel analysis shows how people move step by step on a website, from viewing a page to buying a product. It helps find where most users leave, so you can improve those parts and increase sales.

## üéØ Summary Key Findings:


             High initial drop-off after landing:
            
            Only 22.7% of users who viewed a page actually viewed a product.
            
            ‚ö†Ô∏è 77.3% dropped off between landing and product view ‚Äî this suggests weak product discoverability or lack of user intent.
            
            
            Significant drop from product view to cart:
            
            Only 20.48% of users who viewed a product added it to the cart.

            ‚ö†Ô∏è 79.52% abandoned at this step ‚Äî possible reasons include:
            
            Price hesitation
            
            Lack of trust or urgency
            
            Poor product descriptions or images
            
            
            Checkout flow is strong:
            
            77.44% of users who added to cart started checkout.
            
            ‚úÖ This indicates a healthy checkout initiation rate, meaning cart-level motivation is high.
            
            
            Purchase completion is moderate:
            
            Only 45.49% of those who began checkout completed purchase.
            
            ‚ö†Ô∏è 54.51% dropped at final step ‚Äî likely issues:
            
            Unexpected costs (shipping/taxes)
            
            Complex checkout
            
            Lack of payment options
