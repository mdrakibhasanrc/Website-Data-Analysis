## ðŸŽ¯ Summary Key Findings:


      Strong product engagement: 22.7% view rate, but 77.3% drop after landing â†’ needs homepage optimization.
      
      Healthy add-to-cart rate (20.48%), but high cart (77.44%) and checkout (45.49%) abandonment â†’ opportunity to streamline purchase experience.
      
      AOV is solid at $81.96, but ARPU is low ($1.34) â†’ boost conversions to lift revenue per user.
      
      Bounce rate (32.8%) and session duration (70s) suggest room to improve site stickiness and engagement.
