## ðŸŽ¯ Summary Key Findings:


      Strong product engagement: 22.7% view rate, but 77.3% drop after landing â†’ needs homepage optimization.
      
      Healthy add-to-cart rate (20.48%), but high cart (77.44%) and checkout (45.49%) abandonment â†’ opportunity to streamline purchase experience.
      
      AOV is solid at $81.96, but ARPU is low ($1.34) â†’ boost conversions to lift revenue per user.
      
      Bounce rate (32.8%) and session duration (70s) suggest room to improve site stickiness and engagement.


## âœ…Website Device Analysis

The device analysis reveals that all devices (desktop, mobile, and tablet) experience significant drop-offs after landing, with high cart and checkout abandonment rates, suggesting the need for improved homepage and purchase flow optimizations. Conversion rates and revenue vary by device, with desktop leading in AOV and revenue, while mobile and tablet show opportunities for boosting engagement and conversions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary Key Findings:


    Traffic & Engagement:
    270,154 total users with a bounce rate of 32.82% and avg. session duration of 70 sec, indicating weak user engagement
    and low time spent exploring the site.

    Funnel Drop-offs:
    High drop-off at each stage â€” 77.3% from landing to product page, 79.52% from product to cart, 77.44% from cart to checkout, 
    and 54.51% from checkout to purchase â€” showing major friction throughout the funnel.

    Conversion & Purchase Behavior:
    Final conversion rate is only 1.64%, reflecting the cumulative impact of drop-offs; purchase rate is 45.49% of users who 
    reach checkout, suggesting room for checkout process improvements.

    Revenue Metrics:
     Despite a strong AOV of $81.96, the ARPU is just $1.34, meaning low conversion efficiency is severely limiting revenue per user.


## âœ… Landing Page Analysis Report

Landing Page Analysis is important because it helps identify where users drop off early in their journey, impacting conversion rates. Understanding performance by page type allows targeted improvements to user experience, reducing bounce and abandonment rates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary Key Findings:

      High Drop-offs After Landing:
      
      All landing pages experience significant drop-offs after landing, ranging from 75% (Homepage) to 85% (Checkout Page), showing a need for targeted improvements on key pages to 
      reduce visitor loss.

      Cart & Checkout Abandonment:
      
      Add-to-cart rates vary by page (10% Checkout Page to 25% Product Page), but cart abandonment is consistently high (60% to 80%), and checkout abandonment remains a concern (35% to 
      50%), indicating friction points in the purchase process.

      Conversion & Revenue Performance:
      
      Conversion rates improve progressively from Homepage (1.5%) to Checkout Page (2.5%), with Product Page showing strong performance (2.0%). Revenue and AOV peak at the Product 
       Checkout pages ($110Kâ€“$50K revenue; $85â€“$90 AOV). Other pages underperform with low conversion (1.2%) and revenue ($12,165).

      Engagement Opportunities:
      
      Bounce rates are moderately high across pages (30% to 40%), with average session durations between 55s and 75s, highlighting room to improve user engagement and reduce bounce, 
      especially on Checkout and Collection pages.
